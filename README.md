# fpga_bnn_accelerator
Work in progress of an FPGA implementation of a binary neural network accelerator

## Important: 
This is a snapshot of the developement work on a binary neural network accelerator based on the [TASTE framework](taste.tools).
Soon there will be a first release featuring proper documentation and build instruction for ISE and GHDL.
